# Appendix: Choice of the Editor

I had tried few editor. My first choice of the editor was Jekyll. It is recommended by GitHub, but it turns out that complex deployment and config, and it won't be able to edit directly online. I have to use local machine to generate the website content which would be a littler more work. Then I found gitbook. It is light with good support team. I think it would be the perfect tool for publish and writing article online without any local machine support. And they just release new version of gitbook which is even more better on cooperating write.
