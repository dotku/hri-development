# Appendix: Choice of the Editor

I had tried few editors before GitBook, eg. Wordpress, Drupal or relative modern editor such as Jekyll or Hexo, but it runs out that GitBook would be the best one for me. 

Jekyll is recommended by GitHub. It requires complex deployment and config, and it won't be able to edit directly online. I have to use local machine to generate the website content which would be a littler more work. It might be good for someone doesn't have stable networking, but I'm almost online everyday. Hexo is similar at this case. There are few 3rd party provide cloud editing service, but it is not free.

Then I found GitBook. It is light with good support team with free plan on basic project. I think it would be the perfect tool for publish and writing article online without any local machine maintain work. And they just release new version of GitBook which seems come with better support on cooperating write.
